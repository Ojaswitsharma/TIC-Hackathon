   â€¢ Verified prototype routing functions properly
   â€¢ All output files generated successfully

âœ… DATABASE STRUCTURE:
   â€¢ Both databases now contain exactly 20 customers each
   â€¢ Customer IDs range from "1" to "20" in both databases
   â€¢ All other customer data fields preserved (names, phones, emails, etc.)
   â€¢ Business logic and fraud detection still functional

BENEFITS:
========

ðŸŽ¯ SIMPLICITY:
   â€¢ Much easier to reference customers by simple numeric IDs
   â€¢ Improved readability in logs and debugging
   â€¢ Simplified customer lookup operations

ðŸ”§ MAINTENANCE:
   â€¢ Easier to add new customers with sequential IDs
